<title>The Blessed State of Being</title>
<div class="field-item even">

As a highly creative person who loves new and different things I am blessed to have a body-centered practice to keep me in my body. What my body remembers, my mind often forgets. The connection to my body provides me direct path I can use to re-explore anything over and over again without getting lost.

I listen to my body and the voice that says, “Let’s keep doing this or let’s stop now!” In pursuit of finding the parts of me I feel come alive when I say “yes”, saying “no” is important too. Dropping the old habits is something I am exploring, as often the habit is no longer a “yes”. Guided by internal forces, inner voices, and by the sensation of “yes” I can’t go wrong. My body loves the yes choices and I do too. We both feel the love when I make these kinds of conscious choices.

Functioning from the internal mechanisms inside me, my voice and sensation is what keeps me in touch with me, and with the things important and meaningful to me, like health and well being. Sensing "me" is important. It’s how I make a connection with my divine self. It’s how I stay on my path, the one I am meant to walk and explore.

I am blessed my work is about exploring. Becoming a sensation scientist makes me proud and I know it makes my body happy.

I am blessed that I have Nia and routines. Following a routine, the structure and form is what has allowed me to grow and create more than I ever could have imagined. The process I use is what makes it easy and efficient in exploring my creativity. I love how creating a somatic experience reveals steps that bring me to a destination. In the creative process, every time I step back on the same path, repeat the same steps, a new part of me is revealed.

Inside each of us lives many bodies that offer endless new experiences for new discoveries, yet we are also one singular, ever-present body. Rumi said, “Come come again, no matter how many times you’ve come, come again”. This is the mantra I use to be with my Nia routines, my husband, children, and the Nia principles.

Once I replaced fear with curiosity and began to trust my body and inner wisdom I felt like I jumped back into the world of child-like fascination. A world where everyday is filled with discovery, where every day is for me and for my enjoyment. It makes my life feel so good!

<title>You Know Best!</title>
<div class="field-item even">

You are your own best guide on your journey toward health and wellness because you alone know what sits well with your particular body. Trust your body, your instincts, and intuitions.

If you have wide hips or long limbs, widen your stance to create a sound base; if your back is weak, keep your leg lifts low and cushion them by sinking into your supporting leg. If you’re new to exercise, make your movements small and close in to your body. If you’ve just painted your kitchen and your upper body is sore, let your arm work be floppy and loose. If you’ve spent the day on all fours in your garden, do more pelvic circles to release the tension in your back. In other words, adapt your workout to you, right now.

Exercise, like life, should not be static, but flow and ebb as you flow and ebb.

We all start out with different physical parameters that define our range of motion, flexibility, and points of strength; different body types and shapes; different needs; different ways of speaking through our bodies; different movement philosophies. If you honor your parameters, they will fluctuate. If you work with your body type, respecting its limitations and appreciating its possibilities, you will change faster with less risk of hurting yourself. If you respect your own special needs and evocation of movement, they will help to guide you on a safe and sure path to where you ultimately want to be.

The human machine doesn’t take well to unreasonable demands but is wonderfully adaptable if you treat it right. That means taking the time to build strength, endurance, flexibility, and balance. A fast-food mentality about fitness is not unlike a starve-and-splurge dieting syndrome that can be more damaging emotionally and physically than doing nothing.

Fitness is for the long haul, for a lifetime. Give yourself the immense gratification of developing it with patience, consistency, and joy. Be good to yourself, to that magnificently intricate enterprise called your body.

<title>Quality over Quantity - How to Move Better</title>
<div class="field-item even">

There’s nothing more important to a sensation scientist than the ability to listen to the body and monitor one’s body. I make my living moving closer to the ideal of The Body’s Way. Why? I want to live well and die well, and in order to do this I must continually improve how I use my body. As I age I’m learning I really do have to make movement a part of every day life. I really do have to move fast, slow, big and small to remain adaptable to my everyday life's demands.

I was teaching the Nia class Move I.T. and to my surprise I got a side-stitch. It’s been years since this has happened! I figured it was because I often don’t take myself to the same high level of exertion in my Classic Nia classes as I do in these. I like the rush, the push, the power and fun I have kicking it up a notch. At 62 kicking it up feels great - well, except when I get a side-stitch!

Unusual sensations are important cues that require attention and action. I feel even more compelled now to listen and monitor what my body needs. Having had a heart scare, tracking any signs of abnormal heart action is critical for me.
Gaining body literacy gives me the knowledge to take care of my body by listening to the signals of an irregular pulse, fluttering, jumping, or palpitations in my chest or throat, any sudden burst of rapid heart-beats, or an abrupt drop in my pulse rate. If I sense any of these signals I move more slowly until my heart rate returns to normal, until I feel ease as I breathe. If it keeps happening, as it did one time, I go to the doctor to put my mind and body at ease.

Of course, a side-stitch is nothing to worry about, it's just a diaphragm spasm. It’s an easy fix. Just slow down and purposefully exhale, making sound, breathing into the spasm until it relaxes.

Learn how to monitor your body so you can workout and gain the results you desire. I always tell people it’s far more what you put into a move than the number of repetitions you do. Quality over quantity.

For a day, I decided to put this into practice, bringing this concept into my life. I applied it to everything from brushing my teeth to getting dressed to driving to work. I found myself shifting the quality of all of my movements. I moved slower, and how I felt in motion was incredible. I know I can snap through my day and my workout, but I also know that using just the right amount of energy and effort, and doing just the right number of repetitions for my body and life is what works best. So that day I really felt like I never wasted any of my precious time of life.

The investment and time I put in to experience quality over quantity provided me with many rewards. I went out for a glass of wine at 9:00 PM, still up and energized to see my girls!

<title>Thrive - Take a Dance Break!</title>
<div class="field-item even">

Manage your daily actions and feelings with movement and you can thrive!
Dancing Through Your Life means turning every move you make into something that feels like dancing. It means being responsible to bring dance into your life as the medicine you use to stay happy, calm, and relaxed and healthy - to remain centered in your life. By taking as little as sixty seconds off throughout the day to create moments of full-blown unscripted dance breaks, you can benefit from the medicine of movement. You're wired to move. Movement is the body’s medicine that strengthens and heals. It develops both brain and body. And the best news of all, it's completely organic and natural.

Discover Your Dance
Every body can dance. Think of dance as moving in your own way and in your own time. Dance is something you do to keep your body, mind, emotions, and spirit alert, agile, strong, flexible, mobile, stable and feeling younger. Whether it’s dealing with depression, self-esteem issues, stress, weight loss or anxiety, brief bursts of dance act like pleasure "time release" capsules to make you instantly feel and look better.

How To Do It
I stay connected to the sensation of “peace” in my body, and when tensions arise, if my breath becomes shallow, if my jaw or hands get tight or if my mind gets in the way of me experiencing my life as “joyful”, I take a Nia dance break. No matter where I am, I get up and dance full out. I dance for at least sixty seconds, and if I have access to music, I put on my favorite tune and let rip for the entire song. I take every opportunity to use my dancing and medicine!

To get the most out of your dance break—
• Don’t think, just move. Tap into the power of pre-verbal communication and speak what you feel through your dance using every part of your body. Sound your feelings in voice, too.
• Affirm the changes you feel after dancing by letting the body know you have received the medicine and gifts of moving. Say, “Thank you body, I feel (speak out loud what you notice has shifted)”.
• Invite others to take dance breaks with you, and consciously dance to shift energy in and around you!

<title>The Five Sensations - Stability</title>
<div class="field-item even">

Stability in your muscles is sensed as energy moving from center and out, in all directions. It is the physical feeling of harmony and peace. Stability is the physical feeling of harmony and peace, combined with readiness for action. Stability is not control; it is a letting go that naturally engages the muscle, bones and joints dynamically. Dynamic Stability – the perfect balance of all the sensations – is sensed as powerful peace.

The physical sensations of losing stability are agitation, loss of balance, joint stiffness, fatigue, poor coordination and stress. Physical signs of losing stability are a diminishment in your ability to balance, move gracefully, vary speed, and remain strong yet relaxed. .

In Stability, you will find constancy, integrity, and peace. Stability is more easily found when your base is wide, in stances with your base and legs. Find Stability by squeezing in and lengthening out. In your physical body stability resides in the structures of your base - in the tripod of your foot; in the bowl of your pelvic basin. Stability is the key foundation principle on which to build greater health and well-being.

The five sensations are flexibility, agility, mobility, stability, and strength. Each has its own voice and gift.
To practice the five sensations, become aware of what each sensation feels like in your body, and determine which sensation/s you tend to overdo or under-do. Then apply your five sensations to heal and to create the body you desire.

</div>

<title>The Five Sensations - Strength</title>
<div class="field-item even">

Strength is the core of the power you exert in your life. It is the force that protects; the Warrior, the Lioness, and the Protector-Healer. Strength is a sensation of energy being drawn in and hugging the bones tightly to provide condensed, concentrated energy and power deep within. In your physical body you know Strength with the squeeze of your muscles. Emotionally you may know it in the bear hug of a loved one, or in the competition of a tug of war. Mentally, Strength enables you to maintain your thoughts independent of others. Through use of Strength, your muscles become armor; your bones become martial weapons. Know your power through it. Strength enacts your will.

Strength in your muscles is sensed as energy moving inward. It is the physical feeling of containing and sustaining power. Strength is nurtured by opening and closing joints, and by balancing the action between stability and mobility. Strength is also sensed as a squeezing in or the packing of energy against bones. Dynamic strength, the perfect action between contraction and release, relaxes the body; it never tenses the body.

Strength is a vibration you can physically recognize as positive tension, or energy of a resisting or weighted quality being moved in ways which allow you to sustain a posture. Strength feels like a warm power moving along the bone. It contracts the belly of a muscle without pulling more in one direction than the other, causing either your muscles or joints to say, “Stop, I’m out of balance.”

The physical sensations of losing strength are quivering, pain and fatigue. Losing strength means a diminishment in balance, grace, speed, and coordination.

The five sensations are flexibility, agility, mobility, stability, and strength. Each has its own voice and gift.

</div>

<title>The Five Sensations - Mobility</title>
<div class="field-item even">

Mobility is a free spirit, an energy in constant motion. Similar to the rolling action of the ocean, constantly alive, moving, Mobility undulates, flows, seeks to fill and empty spaces. Mobility resides in your synovial fluid. You know it in the sway of your hip and the in shifting gaze of your eye. Through the freedom of motion, explore space. Like petals on the breeze, move effortlessly in twists and arcs, lofting over and spiraling in corkscrews; eddy and flow until the ebb tide. Go to grasp Mobility and it will slip through your fingers, for confinement extinguishes it. Soften, and it will slip along the smooth contours of your bones and muscles, releasing energy through the gateways of your body. Through Mobility you discover the play of life. Utilize it to get where you want to go. Master it and know the dance of the slow and the gift of the swift.

Mobility in your muscles is sensed as energy moving all around, generally within a range of varied motion. It is the physical feeling of juggling power. Mobility is nurtured by continually opening and closing joints, but neither opening nor closing them all the way.

Mobility is a vibration you can physically recognize as playful tension, an energetic tug-of-war allowing you to sustain whole body movement so the voices of your body say, “I am gaining mobility. I feel free.”

Mobility feels like controlled agitation and excitement around the joints. It engages muscle with bones and joints without starting and stopping the action, or causing your body to say, “Slow down, I can’t continue or balance.”

Dynamic mobility (the perfect action between contraction and release) relaxes the body; it never tenses the body.

The physical sensations of losing mobility are stiffness, pain and fatigue. When you are losing mobility, you notice a diminishment in power, balance, grace, speed, coordination, and in your body’s ability to remain strong yet relaxed. The benefit of sensing mobility is knowing you have the body•mind•spirit ability to consciously move your body and engage specific muscles to achieve a desired mobility result, such as more mobility in the hip joints.

One thing's for sure: movement is key to living a long and healthy life. Movement is a sign of youth, health, fitness and well-being, and if you practice Nia, you know just how good movement can feel. While there are lots of body parts that make motion possible, joints provide us with some of the most important mechanics for moving.

There are 13 primary joints in the body, and each is designed to provide you with various degrees of mobility and stability. When joints are healthy, you have the power to move in all kinds of ways–vertically, horizontally, and in circles and spirals–at any speed.

Some people, like baseball pitchers, have too much mobility and not enough stability. In these instances, repetitive movements often end up doing a lot of damage to the body. Other people have too much stability, which limits their mobility and flexibility. This is extremely common among those who sit in chairs for hours each day. Joints, muscles, and connective tissues become rigid and inelastic. Both instances of excessive mobility and stability can lead to osteoarthritis and other forms of chronic pain, injury, and fatigue. Every body needs a good balance of movement and stillness for healthy living.

Create healthy mobility by trying these tips:

1. While standing, slowly rise onto the balls of both feet, bringing both heels high off the ground. Sustain elevated balance. Then slowly lower both heels back down, sensing for stability in your ankle joints as you stop moving.

2. Walk briskly around the room and stop suddenly, sensing for stability in your knee joints. Repeat this several times.

3. Freely move your upper arm in all directions: up, down, front, back, and around. Sense for mobility in your shoulder joint and notice any resistance. Repeat with the other arm.

4. With your hands holding onto an imaginary blanket, shake the blanket several times, sensing for stability in your spine as you stop moving.

The five sensations are flexibility, agility, mobility, stability, and strength. To practice the five sensations, become aware of what each sensation feels like in your body, and determine which sensation/s you tend to overdo or under-do. Then apply your five sensations to heal and to create the body you desire.

</div>

<title>The Five Sensations -  Agility</title>
<div class="field-item even">

As we continue to discuss the Five Sensations, let's look at Agility. What does agility feel like in the body?

Agility is a trickster and a clown, the dance between Mobility and Stability. It trains the nervous system to respond to a variety of stimuli. Instinctual, Agility enables automatic fight or flight responses to preserve life. It comes from your reptilian brain. Use Agility to get out of a pickle, and back on track, to right your body and avoid falls. Agility offers your physical body the ability to sprint at full speed, turn on a dime, alight on one foot, roll into a somersault and then proceed to walk on a high wire, negotiating the slack in the wire with deft reaction to create stability. Agility bridges the worlds of the still and the frenetic, bringing calm to commotion and quick action to complacency.

Agility in your muscles is sensed as the movement of different tensions, a physical feeling of pulling and pushing. Agility is nurtured by opening and closing the joints in varying ranges of motion, transitioning from active states to balanced stillness. Agility has an energetic tug-o-war quality, and can feel like a playful tension. That tension allows you to move your entire body smoothly.

To sense agility is to feel controlled, reflexive actions that engage the muscle with bones and joints to quickly and consciously start and stop action without causing anything to say, “Stop, I can’t keep this up!” Dynamic agility (the perfect action between contraction and release) relaxes the body; it never tenses the body.

The physical sensations of losing agility are stiffness, pain and fatigue - a loss of balance, grace, speed, and coordination. When you sense agility, you know you have the body•mind•spirit ability to consciously engage and move your body. Agility allows you to use specific muscles to achieve a desired result in stress-free ways. Agility gives your body the ability to remain strong yet relaxed.

The five sensations are flexibility, agility, mobility, stability, and strength. To practice the five sensations, become aware of what each sensation feels like in your body, and determine which sensation/s you tend to overdo or under-do. Then apply your five sensations to heal and to create the body you desire.

</div>

<title>The Five Sensations - Flexibility</title>
<div class="field-item even">

When writing The Nia Technique, something struck me. I was telling people what to do and how to do it, but the language was missing one of the most important elements: What to sense for. Because the science of Nia is based on The Body’s Way, I went to the body to see if I could get some answers.

As always, the body spoke to me and shared how it has five main sensations, which, like taste buds, need to be nourished and fed. These five sensations energetically and physically keep the body balanced, well, fit, and in a state of homeostasis. Learning to self-activate and manage these five sensations is a way to proactively keep your body’s taste buds satisfied.

The five sensations are flexibility, agility, mobility, stability, and strength. Each has its own voice and gift. We will speak on these over the next few weeks.

To practice the five sensations, become aware of what each sensation feels like in your body, and determine which sensation/s you tend to overdo or under-do. Then apply your five sensations to heal and to create the body you desire.

Sensing for Flexibility

Flexibility in your muscles is sensed as energy moving outward, the physical feeling of releasing power. Flexibility is nurtured by opening and closing your joints, balancing the action between stability (non-moving bones and joints) and mobility (moving bones and joints). The action of muscles spiraling over bones cultivates flexibility, as does the action of joint opening.

Flexibility is a vibration physically recognizable as positive tension, energy of elastic quality being moved in ways which allow you to sustain a posture and use muscle groups so the voice of your body registers, “I am getting more flexible. I feel more space.”

Flexibility feels like warmth lengthening along the bone, stretching the belly of the muscle without pulling at its ends, or causing your body to say, “Stop.” Dynamic flexibility (the perfect action between contraction and release) relaxes the body; it never tenses the body.

The physical sensations of losing flexibility are pain, stiffness, cramping and fatigue. Signs of losing flexibility include a weakening in balance, grace, speed, and coordination, and in your body’s ability to remain strong yet relaxed.

The benefit of sensing flexibility is in knowing you have the body•mind•spirit ability to consciously engage and use specific muscles to achieve a desired result, such as more flexibility in your hamstrings.

The Voice of Flexibility

I am the voice of Flexibility. I give you the freedom to expand in your life. My sensation is one of energy radiating outward like the sun radiates heat. I feel to you like a rubber band expanding and extending in all directions; I am the yawn of your body. Extending outward in all directions, my pliability creates space within and connects your edges to the world beyond. To your emotional body I am the product of yearning and desire, contentment and satiation, security and curiosity.

Connect to me through Desire and in your longing, open up to expose your deepest self. Through me, find trust and expansion; discover your full potential. You know me through the first stretch of waking. Feline, I love to extend to know my fullness down to the toes and out the tail - into the claws and the spaces between.

I am your potential. Let me in by letting yourself out.

<title>How You Become A Sensation Scientist</title>
<div class="field-item even">

To be a sensation scientist means to live in constant awareness of sensation—to closely observe and respond to the information our bodies are sending us at all times. This allows us to develop a deep level of self-knowing, so we can continually grow and endlessly explore the human body—and the infinite movement potential it contains.

To be body literate is to be able to read the signals of your body—to fluently “speak” all four languages of its physical, mental, emotional and spiritual realms. This may sound like a lot to process at once, but rest assured, you already have this ability within you. You were born a sensation scientist.

Think about it: The first information you ever gained came as an infant, through a pre-verbal world of “sensing to know.” In this phase of awareness, you simply sensed life through your body and responded. Through an ingenious, almost magical design of cells, muscles, bones, joints, connective tissues and neuromuscular systems, your body told you, “I need food. I want to be held. I need my diapers changed. I feel pain. I feel comfort.” There were no words, no quantifying ideas about whether an experience was “good” or “bad.” Your body just guided you through the world via sight, sound, smell, touch, taste and emotion—through sensation. This is what the body is naturally coded to do. Essentially, as an infant, you were already practicing sensation science—in fact, you were in the highest state of body literacy possible!

Now just imagine if your life as sensation scientist—if your acute awareness of and connection to sensation—never took “back burner” when you began to speak. Imagine if you remained body literate through adulthood, reading the signals from your body and allowing this information to guide you into your fullest state of health, happiness and fulfillment. How would your body be affected? How would your mind and emotions change? How might your self-confidence, self-trust and self-knowing be affected, and how would this impact your relationships with others?

By reclaiming ourselves as sensation scientists, we tap back into our natural state of body literacy and deep self-knowing, which allows us to live happier, healthier, more fulfilled lives. This is the ultimate goal of all physical education, and particularly of Nia education, which reveals that by following The Body’s Way, we can all achieve life mastery.

You can become a sensation scientist by:

• Acknowledging that you were born a sensation scientist—you have all the tools you need. You are both the scientist and the laboratory itself.
• Objectively researching the form and function of the human body, and develop an ongoing relationship with sensation, the "voice" of the body.
• Applying the study of sensation to gain a better understanding of how to move, communicate with, and live in your bodies in a more healthy and functional way.
• Consciously committing to body literacy each day. For example, each morning upon waking, make a practice of noticing the very first thing you sense in your body, mind, emotions and spirit, then speak each sensation aloud. Learn to notice, feel, listen, and respond to the messages from your body.

<title>Listen To Your Body and Dance Through Life</title>
<div class="field-item even">

"Dancing Through Life" is a daily approach to self-healing on an ongoing basis. Whether you are in or out of class, at work or at home, connecting to your body helps you to recognize what feels out of sync, uncomfortable, and out of balance. If you pay daily attention to the little aches and pains, your chances of avoiding injury are greater. Your ability to self-heal in order to improve your fitness is guaranteed.

Your body continually speaks to you through the voices of pleasure and discomfort. When you listen to the voices of your body you can recognize what parts of you need your attention and love. "Dance Through Life" by:

1. Practicing Body Listening

When you woke up in the morning breathe deeply, tune in to your body, and hear what it has to say. Feel and sense your physical body and discover what parts need healing. Become aware of the places within you that feel pain - the sore muscles, the twinging back. Become aware of the strong beat of your heart, the feel of air moving through your lungs. Do you feel healthy, unhealthy? Listen to your body and pay attention to details.

2. Using Movement as Stimulation

Stimulation uses simple, basic movement to create self-healing. Stimulate by moving gently. Open and close the joints surrounding the body part you feel needs healing. These movements feed the body with healing energy. Movement heals, movement creates fitness.

3. Using Everyday Motions To Heal

Use daily activities to heal your body. If your shoulder is tight, keep the palms of your hands face up to open the shoulder joint and to help relax your neck and shoulders. Reach gently for your coffee cup, feeling the motion as it expands your elbow, wrist, and bicep. Throughout the day as you walk, drive, eat, and so on, consciously listen to what your body does to tune in, heal and realign your body.

4. Dancing Through Life

Someone is always listening to you - it is your body. Someone is always in charge of how you feel - that is you. Approach every step, every motion and gesture you make as a mindful and conscious dance. This is a loving way to be within the body that turns everyday acts into a graceful expression of joy. When you "Dance Through Life" you feed your soul, you set your spirit free, and you learn to play in the magical healing ocean we call life. When you "Dance Through Life" you heal and get fit.

</div>

<title>Stop Exercising and Start Moving!</title>
<div class="field-item even">

The joy of movement is the secret of fitness. In and out of class, stop exercising and start moving. Follow the Pleasure Principle: if it feels good, do it; if it doesn't, stop. Remember that when people make love it's usually to feel good, not just to procreate, and movement is the same. Fitness is merely a by-product of moving, just as procreation is a by-product of sex. Ask yourself, "How much of the time do I really physically experience the depth of joy that I know is available to me as I dance and share through the body?" Stay connected to the sensation of joy.

Fitness must address the human being, not just the body. Exercise that's done strictly for it's own physical sake, divorced from emotions and the human spirit, isn't satisfying, isn't fun, and eventually fails. To feel good enough to last a lifetime, an exercise regimen must satisfy the heart and soul. When the body, mind, emotions and spirit are integrated, virtually anything is possible. Stay connected to language and sensation, experiencing all four parts of being human: the physical, mental, emotional and spiritual.

Movement must be conscious, not habitual. Whole-being fitness begins with heightened awareness of both body and mind. To achieve this, you need to turn off the automatic pilot that so often governs your movements and thoughts. Living (and moving) by rote kills consciousness and waters down the experience of life, turning people into robotic hamsters on a treadmill. People often try to regain awareness by using just their minds. That's the hard way, and we don't believe in the hard way. A better approach is to start focusing throughout the day on all the physical sensations coursing throughout your body, and to start moving with purpose. Making these simple connections with your own body is the easy way to increase awareness and it paves the way for more elevated neurological and psychological connections. Ask yourself, "How much of the time do I really relate to everything as energy?"

Use your body the way it was designed to be used. Stop jogging. Stop jumping up and down. Stop straining muscles with heavy weights. Instead, gain fitness by doing movements that shift your body's own weight, with varying levels of intensity, range, and speed. Replace jogging, jumping and lifting with stances, postures, steps, blocks and kicks that are compatible with your body's natural structure, and that feel good. These movements will burn calories, reduce body fat, create strength and muscle definition, and promote balance, grace, flexibility, endurance and good posture. Ask yourself, "How much of the time do I take what is - what I know and do - and create something new, something transforming for my work and my self?"

<title>Fabulous Post</title>
<div class="field-item even">

Life as Art is one of my most favorite philosophical statements. Whether it’s music and the effect of vibration, color and shape, textures, taste, art needs no explanation - or for that matter, understanding. I merely need to stop long enough to listen to the music, see the color, taste the food, touch and sense life deep in my body, letting the canvas and artist of the Universe know I am paying attention.

I love to sit with a glass of great wine at the end of the day, people-watching: sensing each person and hearing their sound. I perceive sound expressed through people’s bodies. I hear sounds and feel resonance when I tune into what people are thinking, how they do what they do. Everything makes sound, vibrations.

When I dance, look at people, and quiet my inner thoughts to listen I become one with all people, connected to the “one” heart, and to what Ken Wilber calls the “great chain of being”. I like to think there is a mind of the great chain of being bringing me and us all closer to peace, harmony and human-spiritual greatness. The Universal language that speaks to me and I believe all people, no matter who they are or what language they speak, is the language of love and the body.

To me, becoming responsible for the sound of my own body and life means becoming conscious of my thoughts, actions and words. Managing my vibrations as part of each day is how I help support a green universe. Sensing the song of me in the universe, voiced as love and pleasure - that's the music I want to make today. I want to use my resonance to heal me, heal you, and the world.

Those of us who live in a human body, in pursuit of expanding our consciousnesses, are blessed. We are awake to deep inner needs and desires. We somehow know the feeling of getting close to the horizon where stepping off into our spiritual self attunes us with our higher self and with the mastery of living as spirits in flesh. We get the rush, the buzz, the quiver, and the high of being high on life and spirit.

I am the artist and I am also a part of the art. Today I shall dress accordingly and create art. I will inspire. I pray for this. I dance for this.

<title>Softening and Release: Healing Journeys</title>
<div class="field-item even">

Today I am motivated to move freely in unbound and unconstricted ways. I want to allow what I sense as armor to slowly fall away. Underneath my armor is a softer, more adaptable, pliable me. A softer, more resilient part of me I can use to become powerful and to sustain me in living my life.

In the sensation of my life and dance I have many opportunities to pay attention and recognize change, to acknowledge, forgive and let go. Then why is letting go so difficult at times? I get how what was once a part of me could be something I no longer need. I know there are experiences from my past I want to release. I know each day is a new day, complete with the freedom to hold onto things or let them go. Yes, the events from my past may have a hold on me sometimes. Always, movement and dance helps me to reclaim my injured parts. And sometimes there are things I just don't want to let go of - things I want to see again, feel again, hear again. It’s staying in the moment I want to cultivate, even though I have so many things that make the now so slow!

When I need to I’ll gear down and lighten to accommodate my life and body's fluctuating needs. It's okay to ease up, and it’s even important to do so. Slow is good as it develops heightened sensory awareness. When I allow myself to ebb and flow, heeding my body's cues, I get a lot further, faster.

Softness - who knew it was the way into power? I shall practice being soft my entire life, as I feel so at home with Yang. Still, as I age, I am learning to befriend soft, because I must. No matter how much I pump and press, truth is, shift happens.
